            <p>
                This meme, in my words, conveys how HR, Human Resources, is stressful to some workers. HR is usually spoken about as a place of work
                that is associated with a lot of paperwork, and the use of computers as well to find, recruit, and train job applications. I can only
                imagine how difficult it must be to be looking at hundreds of paperwork a day. This type of work is bound to get stressful and mentally
                exhausting for you. For a person having to read and looking at a screen all day is also bad for their eyesight. This shows how the
                child using their hands to stretch their face downwards, showing a distressed and annoyed face, shows how the worker is tired of their
                work in HR.

        <h2>Genevive Grotjan, American Mathematician and Cryptanalyst</h2>

        <p> Genevive Grotjan was discovered in September of 1940 due to her breakthrough. The Army Signal Intelligence 
            Service (SIS) built an analog machine to decipher the Japanese diplomatic system. The project was called 
            “Purple”. She was known to be good at noticing the differences between the ciphertext and plaintext in 
            messages. Which prompted her to be assigned to a project In October of 1943, the “Venona” project, to 
            decipher the Soviet problem. 

            She was hired into SIS by William Friedman in 1939. She married Hyman Feinstein, a chemist at the 
            National Bureau of Standards in 1943. She later went on to serve as a cryptanalyst and research analyst 
            for the government for over 7 years. Later on, she resigned on May 4 1947. After her resignation, she became
            a mathematics professor at George Mason University. She unfortunately died in 2006 at the age of 93. Her 
            husband, Hyman Feinstein died in 1995 but had established an award in cryptology at George Mason University,
            in honor of his wife. She was also inducted into the NSA/CSS, the Cryptologic Hall of Honor in 2010.
