            <p>This meme, in my words, coveys how machine learning is shown to be, in reality, 
            statistics. So far, from what I have learned in my time in this program, machine learning
             is when a machine learns through an algorithm made by human programmers. In short, 
             machine learning just uses a lot of information that is put into a program to learn. 
             Not only does it only learn, but it also corrects itself when they don’t learn something 
             correctly. It adapts and does the changes necessary while also gaining information. In 
             general, machine learning is just statistics due to statistics being a collection of 
             information. Machine learning just has statistics imbedded into it.

        <h2>Genevive Grotjan, American Mathematician and Cryptanalyst</h2>

        <p> Genevive Grotjan was discovered in September of 1940 due to her breakthrough. The Army Signal Intelligence 
            Service (SIS) built an analog machine to decipher the Japanese diplomatic system. The project was called 
            “Purple”. She was known to be good at noticing the differences between the ciphertext and plaintext in 
            messages. Which prompted her to be assigned to a project In October of 1943, the “Venona” project, to 
            decipher the Soviet problem. 

            She was hired into SIS by William Friedman in 1939. She married Hyman Feinstein, a chemist at the 
            National Bureau of Standards in 1943. She later went on to serve as a cryptanalyst and research analyst 
            for the government for over 7 years. Later on, she resigned on May 4 1947. After her resignation, she became
            a mathematics professor at George Mason University. She unfortunately died in 2006 at the age of 93. Her 
            husband, Hyman Feinstein died in 1995 but had established an award in cryptology at George Mason University,
            in honor of his wife. She was also inducted into the NSA/CSS, the Cryptologic Hall of Honor in 2010.
