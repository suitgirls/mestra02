    <h2>Infographic Analysis</h2>

    <p>The infographic shown above is the topic that I decided to go with for this project. I decided to make an infographic on music and the analysis
    of the main genres being played all around the world. When I looked at it like that, I decided that It was too vague so I instead focused on the
    main genres played throughout the world, but by 20-24 year olds. This allowed me to get a more in- depth analysis and to be able to do the 
    necessary research needed to create the infographic. I liked being able to research something I loved while also being able to see how widely
    different music genres were being played by young adults.

    <h2>Crypto Rush ✨</h2>

    <h3>Melissa Estrada, Friday 7/21/23</h3>

    <img src="cryptorushgroupphoto.jpg">

    <P>The game that I made with my classmates, Ipek and Hannah, was a game about encrypting words into the Caeser cipher alphabet. To start off the game,
    you and another player have to roll a 6-sided dice. Whatever number you roll, is the N value for you to modify into your normal alphabet to make
    your new ceaser cipher alphabet. You are then given the flashcards that have the new alphabet ready for you already. Once you have your new 
    alphabet, there is a stack of cards that are faced down. These cards have normal words in them for you to make encrypt into the new alphabet 
    that was given to you. You and the player will be writing down as many words you can into a whiteboard. Not to mention, you have a time limit 
    of 5 minutes to write as many words you can and as well as having a point system to each word you write. You will get one point for every letter
    of the word on the card and whoever gets the most points wins. The challenges on creating the game were having to discuss ideas within my group. 
    At first, this game was going to be a charades type like game. So, we had to discuss for a long time to come up with the game we have now. I believe 
    that we were given a lot of feedback, so I probably would’ve taken that feedback and addressed the problems done with the game. For example, my TA, 
    Tay, told me that it would’ve been more convenient to create a set of rules, so we don’t have to explain them every time someone comes to play the 
    game. This activity allowed me to show my creativity in many ways, technology wise as well!

    <h2>My Favorite HTML Tutorial</h2>

    <h3>Melissa Estrada, Wednesday 7/19/23</h3>

<p>I decided to choose this video not only because of the aesthetically pleasing thumbnail, but beacuse she was also talking about 
making her own website! I wanted to include this video because I liked how she started off by making a moodboard of what type of colors 
she wanted to include into her website. I personally like making moodboards about things through my pinterest account but I also feel if 
I were to make my own website later on, moodboards would be useful. She also talked about the header that she had and how she was changing 
the typography on it. I liked how she talked not only about a random font she wanted for her header, but also went into depth about the placements 
and on why she chose it. She spoke on the designs that she wanted to include into her website and I liked how she also explained how "cozy" she 
wanted her website to feel to her audience. She went on to start desigining her website with all of the details she talked about! This concluded 
the first part of her video. She went on to design a wideframe for her website on Figma that is like a small 2 setence introduction. She made it 
in three different sizes. She went into the coding part of the website and then finished the video. Aside from the website building aspect of this video, it also felt like she was familiar. Not in the way were I know her 
personally, but she makes her videos feel comforting and as if your friends with her due to how up close and person they fell at times.

     <h2>meme analysis</h2>

     <h3>Melissa Estrada, Tuesday, 7/18/23</h3>

<img src="scoobydoomeme.jpeg">

            <p>This meme, in my words, coveys how machine learning is shown to be, in reality, 
            statistics. So far, from what I have learned in my time in this program, machine learning
             is when a machine learns through an algorithm made by human programmers. In short, 
             machine learning just uses a lot of information that is put into a program to learn. 
             Not only does it only learn, but it also corrects itself when they don’t learn something 
             correctly. It adapts and does the changes necessary while also gaining information. In 
             general, machine learning is just statistics due to statistics being a collection of 
             information. Machine learning just has statistics imbedded into it.

        <h2>Genevive Grotjan, American Mathematician and Cryptanalyst</h2>

        <h3>Melissa Estrada, Monday 7/17/23</h3>

        <p> Genevive Grotjan was discovered in September of 1940 due to her breakthrough. The Army Signal Intelligence 
            Service (SIS) built an analog machine to decipher the Japanese diplomatic system. The project was called 
            “Purple”. She was known to be good at noticing the differences between the ciphertext and plaintext in 
            messages. Which prompted her to be assigned to a project In October of 1943, the “Venona” project, to 
            decipher the Soviet problem. 

            She was hired into SIS by William Friedman in 1939. She married Hyman Feinstein, a chemist at the 
            National Bureau of Standards in 1943. She later went on to serve as a cryptanalyst and research analyst 
            for the government for over 7 years. Later on, she resigned on May 4 1947. After her resignation, she became
            a mathematics professor at George Mason University. She unfortunately died in 2006 at the age of 93. Her 
            husband, Hyman Feinstein died in 1995 but had established an award in cryptology at George Mason University,
            in honor of his wife. She was also inducted into the NSA/CSS, the Cryptologic Hall of Honor in 2010.
