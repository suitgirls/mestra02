        <h1>Melissa Estrada's Biography</h1>

        <p> Hello, My name is Melissa, but you can also call me Meli. I am 15 years old, about to turn 16, 
            <strong>I grew up and live in Houston, Texas.</strong> I'm going to be entering my Junior year at Yes Prep Fifth Ward. 
            I decided to take this class because I have always had an interest in technology. I believe that this class 
            will not only deep my love for technology, but also help me gain the knowledge eligible to pursue it in the
            future. My specific interest in technology, from what I've been able to research so far, is computer engineering.
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Life</h2>

        <p>Outside of school, I am an <strong>artistic, musical and creative person!</strong> I draw mostly characters from shows I like 
            and realistic drawings. As for my music taste, I listen to a variety but the most frequent genres I listen 
            to are Jpop, Kpop, Broadway, and Alternative lo-fi. I like to crochet, learn/play instruments, watch anime, 
            and going to concerts. ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ
